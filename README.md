**MantaRay** is an open-source renderer currently under development. It uses modern rendering techniques to generate photorealistic images of complex scenes. 
 
### Setup Instructions For Developers

Only a few steps are required to begin developing on MantaRay:
1. Install Python 3
2. Clone the MantaRay repository
3. Open ```project/mantaray.sln``` in Microsoft Visual Studio
4. Right click on **mantaray_demos** and select 'Set as StartUp Project'
5. Run the application

All output from the demos is by default directed to: ```workspace/render/bitmap```

#### You are now ready to begin development!
